👋 Hi I'm Fabien, Software developer living in the French Alps. 

I'm developping mainly in PHP, but I love discover and testing things.

I felt in love with the Symfony ecosystem, now I work as a freelancer, as a lead-developer, 
and I also give training courses on Symfony and Api platform frameworks.
