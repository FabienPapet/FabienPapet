👋 Hi I'm Fabien, Software developer living in the 🇫🇷 French Alps. 

I'm developping mainly in 🐘 PHP, but I love discover and testing things.

I felt in love with the Symfony ecosystem, passed Symfony 4, 5, 6 certifications and now I work as a freelancer, as a lead-developer. I also give training courses on Symfony and Api-Platform frameworks.

Feel free to reach me on twitter [@fabienpapet](https://twitter.com/fabienpapet)
